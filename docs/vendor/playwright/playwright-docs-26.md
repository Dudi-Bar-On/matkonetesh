## Download from artifact repository

By default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft's CDN.

Sometimes companies maintain an internal artifact repository to host browser
binaries. In this case, Playwright can be configured to download from a custom
location using the `PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST` env variable.

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=js
PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1 npx playwright install
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=js
set PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1
npx playwright install
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=js
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST="http://192.0.2.1"
npx playwright install
```

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=python
pip install playwright
PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1 playwright install
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=python
set PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=python
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST="http://192.0.2.1"
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=java
PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1 mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install"
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=java
set PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1
mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install"
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=java
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST="http://192.0.2.1"
mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install"
```

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=csharp
PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1 pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 install
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=csharp
set PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 install
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=csharp
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST="http://192.0.2.1"
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 install
```

It is also possible to use a per-browser download hosts using `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD_HOST`, `PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST` and `PLAYWRIGHT_WEBKIT_DOWNLOAD_HOST` env variables that
take precedence over `PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST`.

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=js
PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://203.0.113.3 PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1 npx playwright install
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=js
set PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://203.0.113.3
set PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1
npx playwright install
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=js
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST="http://203.0.113.3"
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST="http://192.0.2.1"
npx playwright install
```

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=python
pip install playwright
PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://203.0.113.3 PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1 playwright install
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=python
set PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://203.0.113.3
set PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=python
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST="http://203.0.113.3"
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST="http://192.0.2.1"
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=java
PLAYWRIGHT_FIREFOX_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://203.0.113.3 PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://192.0.2.1 mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install"
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=java

## Using a pre-installed Node.js
* langs: python, java, dotnet
By default, Playwright uses its bundled Node.js runtime for operations such as browser installation and script execution. If you want Playwright to use a pre-installed Node.js binary instead of the bundled runtime, you can specify it using the `PLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH` environment variable. This can be useful in environments where you need to use a specific version of Node.js or where the bundled runtime is not compatible.

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=js
PLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH="/usr/local/bin/node" npx playwright install
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=js
set PLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH=C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe
npx playwright install
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=js
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH="C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe"
npx playwright install
```

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=python
pip install playwright
PLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH="/usr/local/bin/node" playwright install
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=python
set PLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH=C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=python
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH="C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe"
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=java
PLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH="/usr/local/bin/node" mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install"
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=java
set PLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH=C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe
mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install"
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=java
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH="C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe"
mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install"
```

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=csharp
PLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH="/usr/local/bin/node" pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 install
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=csharp
set PLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH=C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 install
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=csharp
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_NODEJS_PATH="C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe"
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 install
