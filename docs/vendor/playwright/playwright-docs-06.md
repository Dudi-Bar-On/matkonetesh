## Introduction

Playwright can be used to test your application for many types of accessibility issues.

A few examples of problems this can catch include:
- Text that would be hard to read for users with vision impairments due to poor color contrast with the background behind it
- UI controls and form elements without labels that a screen reader could identify
- Interactive elements with duplicate IDs which can confuse assistive technologies

The following examples rely on the [`@axe-core/playwright`](https://npmjs.org/@axe-core/playwright) package which adds support for running the [axe accessibility testing engine](https://www.deque.com/axe/) as part of your Playwright tests.

:::note[Disclaimer]
Automated accessibility tests can detect some common accessibility problems such as missing or invalid properties. But many accessibility problems can only be discovered through manual testing. We recommend using a combination of automated testing, manual accessibility assessments, and inclusive user testing.

For manual assessments, we recommend [Accessibility Insights for Web](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/web/overview/?referrer=playwright-accessibility-testing-js), a free and open source dev tool that walks you through assessing a website for [WCAG 2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_customize&levels=aaa) coverage.

## Example accessibility tests

Accessibility tests work just like any other Playwright test. You can either create separate test cases for them, or integrate accessibility scans and assertions into your existing test cases.

The following examples demonstrate a few basic accessibility testing scenarios.

### Scanning an entire page

This example demonstrates how to test an entire page for automatically detectable accessibility violations. The test:
1. Imports the `@axe-core/playwright` package
1. Uses normal Playwright Test syntax to define a test case
1. Uses normal Playwright syntax to navigate to the page under test
1. Awaits `AxeBuilder.analyze()` to run the accessibility scan against the page
1. Uses normal Playwright Test [assertions](./test-assertions) to verify that there are no violations in the returned scan results

```js tab=js-ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import AxeBuilder from '@axe-core/playwright'; // 1

test.describe('homepage', () => { // 2
  test('should not have any automatically detectable accessibility issues', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('https://your-site.com/'); // 3

    const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze(); // 4

    expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]); // 5
  });
});
```

```js tab=js-js
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');
const AxeBuilder = require('@axe-core/playwright').default; // 1

test.describe('homepage', () => { // 2
  test('should not have any automatically detectable accessibility issues', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('https://your-site.com/'); // 3

    const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze(); // 4

    expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]); // 5
  });
});
```

### Configuring axe to scan a specific part of a page

`@axe-core/playwright` supports many configuration options for axe. You can specify these options by using a Builder pattern with the `AxeBuilder` class.

For example, you can use [`AxeBuilder.include()`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core-npm/blob/develop/packages/playwright/README.md#axebuilderincludeselector-string--string) to constrain an accessibility scan to only run against one specific part of a page.

`AxeBuilder.analyze()` will scan the page *in its current state* when you call it. To scan parts of a page that are revealed based on UI interactions, use [Locators](./locators.md) to interact with the page before invoking `analyze()`:

```js
test('navigation menu should not have automatically detectable accessibility violations', async ({
  page,
}) => {
  await page.goto('https://your-site.com/');

  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Navigation Menu' }).click();

  // It is important to waitFor() the page to be in the desired
  // state *before* running analyze(). Otherwise, axe might not
  // find all the elements your test expects it to scan.
  await page.locator('#navigation-menu-flyout').waitFor();

  const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page })
      .include('#navigation-menu-flyout')
      .analyze();

  expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);
});
```

### Scanning for WCAG violations

By default, axe checks against a wide variety of accessibility rules. Some of these rules correspond to specific success criteria from the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), and others are "best practice" rules that are not specifically required by any WCAG criterion.

You can constrain an accessibility scan to only run those rules which are "tagged" as corresponding to specific WCAG success criteria by using [`AxeBuilder.withTags()`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core-npm/blob/develop/packages/playwright/README.md#axebuilderwithtagstags-stringarray). For example, [Accessibility Insights for Web's Automated Checks](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/web/getstarted/fastpass/?referrer=playwright-accessibility-testing-js) only include axe rules that test for violations of WCAG A and AA success criteria; to match that behavior, you would use the tags `wcag2a`, `wcag2aa`, `wcag21a`, and `wcag21aa`.

Note that automated testing cannot detect all types of WCAG violations.

```js
test('should not have any automatically detectable WCAG A or AA violations', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://your-site.com/');

  const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page })
      .withTags(['wcag2a', 'wcag2aa', 'wcag21a', 'wcag21aa'])
      .analyze();

  expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);
});
```

You can find a complete listing of the rule tags axe-core supports in [the "Axe-core Tags" section of the axe API documentation](https://www.deque.com/axe/core-documentation/api-documentation/#axecore-tags).
