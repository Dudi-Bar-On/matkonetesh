## Install system dependencies

System dependencies can get installed automatically. This is useful for CI environments.

```bash js
npx playwright install-deps
```

```bash java
mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install-deps"
```

```bash python
playwright install-deps
```

```bash csharp
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 install-deps
```

You can also install the dependencies for a single browser by passing it as an argument:

```bash js
npx playwright install-deps chromium
```

```bash java
mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install-deps chromium"
```

```bash python
playwright install-deps chromium
```

```bash csharp
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 install-deps chromium
```

It's also possible to combine `install-deps` with `install` so that the browsers and OS dependencies are installed with a single command.

```bash js
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

```bash java
mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install --with-deps chromium"
```

```bash python
playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

```bash csharp
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 install --with-deps chromium
```

See [system requirements](./intro.md#system-requirements) for officially supported operating systems.

## Update Playwright regularly
* langs: js

By keeping your Playwright version up to date you will be able to use new features and test your app on the latest browser versions and catch failures before the latest browser version is released to the public.

```bash
# Update playwright
npm install -D @playwright/test@latest

# Install new browsers
npx playwright install
```
Check the [release notes](./release-notes.md) to see what the latest version is and what changes have been released.

```bash
# See what version of Playwright you have by running the following command
npx playwright --version
```

## Configure Browsers

Playwright can run tests on Chromium, WebKit and Firefox browsers as well as branded browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. It can also run on emulated tablet and mobile devices. See the [registry of device parameters](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/main/packages/isomorphic/deviceDescriptorsSource.json) for a complete list of selected desktop, tablet and mobile devices.

### Run tests on different browsers
* langs: js

Playwright can run your tests in multiple browsers and configurations by setting up **projects** in the config. You can also add [different options](./test-configuration) for each project.

```js
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    /* Test against desktop browsers */
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },
    {
      name: 'firefox',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
    },
    {
      name: 'webkit',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] },
    },
    /* Test against mobile viewports. */
    {
      name: 'Mobile Chrome',
      use: { ...devices['Pixel 5'] },
    },
    {
      name: 'Mobile Safari',
      use: { ...devices['iPhone 12'] },
    },
    /* Test against branded browsers. */
    {
      name: 'Google Chrome',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'], channel: 'chrome' }, // or 'chrome-beta'
    },
    {
      name: 'Microsoft Edge',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Edge'], channel: 'msedge' }, // or 'msedge-dev'
    },
  ],
});
```

Playwright will run all projects by default.

```bash
npx playwright test

Running 7 tests using 5 workers

  ✓ [chromium] › example.spec.ts:3:1 › basic test (2s)
  ✓ [firefox] › example.spec.ts:3:1 › basic test (2s)
  ✓ [webkit] › example.spec.ts:3:1 › basic test (2s)
  ✓ [Mobile Chrome] › example.spec.ts:3:1 › basic test (2s)
  ✓ [Mobile Safari] › example.spec.ts:3:1 › basic test (2s)
  ✓ [Google Chrome] › example.spec.ts:3:1 › basic test (2s)
  ✓ [Microsoft Edge] › example.spec.ts:3:1 › basic test (2s)
```

Use the `--project` command line option to run a single project.

```bash
npx playwright test --project=firefox

Running 1 test using 1 worker

  ✓ [firefox] › example.spec.ts:3:1 › basic test (2s)
```

With the VS Code extension you can run your tests on different browsers by checking the checkbox next to the browser name in the Playwright sidebar. These names are defined in your Playwright config file under the projects section. The default config when installing Playwright gives you 3 projects, Chromium, Firefox and WebKit. The first project is selected by default.

To run tests on multiple projects(browsers), select each project by checking the checkboxes next to the project name.

### Run tests on different browsers
* langs: python

Run tests on a specific browser:

```bash
pytest test_login.py --browser webkit
```

Run tests on multiple browsers:

```bash
pytest test_login.py --browser webkit --browser firefox
```

Test against mobile viewports:

```bash
pytest test_login.py --device="iPhone 13"
```
Test against branded browsers:

```bash
pytest test_login.py --browser-channel msedge
```

### Run tests on different browsers
* langs: java

Run tests on a specific browser:

```java
import com.microsoft.playwright.*;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try (Playwright playwright = Playwright.create()) {
      // Launch chromium, firefox or webkit.
      Browser browser = playwright.chromium().launch();
      Page page = browser.newPage();
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

Run tests on multiple browsers and make it based on the environment variable `BROWSER`:

```java
import com.microsoft.playwright.*;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try (Playwright playwright = Playwright.create()) {
      Browser browser = null;
      String browserName = System.getenv("BROWSER");
      if (browserName.equals("chromium")) {
        browser = playwright.chromium().launch();
      } else if (browserName.equals("firefox")) {
        browser = playwright.firefox().launch();
      } else if (browserName.equals("webkit")) {
        browser = playwright.webkit().launch();
      }
      Page page = browser.newPage();
      // ...
    }
  }
}
```

### Run tests on different browsers
* langs: csharp

Run tests on a specific browser:

```bash
dotnet test -- Playwright.BrowserName=webkit
```

To run your test on multiple browsers or configurations you need to invoke the `dotnet test` command multiple times. You can either specify the `BROWSER` environment variable or set the `Playwright.BrowserName` via the runsettings file:

```bash
dotnet test --settings:chromium.runsettings
dotnet test --settings:firefox.runsettings
dotnet test --settings:webkit.runsettings
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <RunSettings>
    <Playwright>
      <BrowserName>chromium</BrowserName>
    </Playwright>
  </RunSettings>
```
