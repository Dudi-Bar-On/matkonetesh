## Handling known issues

A common question when adding accessibility tests to an application is "how do I suppress known violations?" The following examples demonstrate a few techniques you can use.

### Excluding individual elements from a scan

If your application contains a few specific elements with known issues, you can use [`AxeBuilder.exclude()`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core-npm/blob/develop/packages/playwright/README.md#axebuilderexcludeselector-string--string) to exclude them from being scanned until you're able to fix the issues.

This is usually the simplest option, but it has some important downsides:
* `exclude()` will exclude the specified elements *and all of their descendants*. Avoid using it with components that contain many children.
* `exclude()` will prevent *all* rules from running against the specified elements, not just the rules corresponding to known issues.

Here is an example of excluding one element from being scanned in one specific test:

```js
test('should not have any accessibility violations outside of elements with known issues', async ({
  page,
}) => {
  await page.goto('https://your-site.com/page-with-known-issues');

  const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page })
      .exclude('#element-with-known-issue')
      .analyze();

  expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);
});
```

If the element in question is used repeatedly in many pages, consider [using a test fixture](#using-a-test-fixture-for-common-axe-configuration) to reuse the same `AxeBuilder` configuration across multiple tests.

### Disabling individual scan rules

If your application contains many different preexisting violations of a specific rule, you can use [`AxeBuilder.disableRules()`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core-npm/blob/develop/packages/playwright/README.md#axebuilderdisablerulesrules-stringarray) to temporarily disable individual rules until you're able to fix the issues.

You can find the rule IDs to pass to `disableRules()` in the `id` property of the violations you want to suppress. A [complete list of axe's rules](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/master/doc/rule-descriptions.md) can be found in `axe-core`'s documentation.

```js
test('should not have any accessibility violations outside of rules with known issues', async ({
  page,
}) => {
  await page.goto('https://your-site.com/page-with-known-issues');

  const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page })
      .disableRules(['duplicate-id'])
      .analyze();

  expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);
});
```

### Using snapshots to allow specific known issues

If you would like to allow for a more granular set of known issues, you can use [Snapshots](./test-snapshots.md) to verify that a set of preexisting violations has not changed. This approach avoids the downsides of using `AxeBuilder.exclude()` at the cost of slightly more complexity and fragility.

Do not use a snapshot of the entire `accessibilityScanResults.violations` array. It contains implementation details of the elements in question, such as a snippet of their rendered HTML; if you include these in your snapshots, it will make your tests prone to breaking every time one of the components in question changes for an unrelated reason:

```js
// Don't do this! This is fragile.
expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toMatchSnapshot();
```

Instead, create a *fingerprint* of the violation(s) in question that contains only enough information to uniquely identify the issue, and use a snapshot of the fingerprint:

```js
// This is less fragile than snapshotting the entire violations array.
expect(violationFingerprints(accessibilityScanResults)).toMatchSnapshot();

// my-test-utils.js
function violationFingerprints(accessibilityScanResults) {
  const violationFingerprints = accessibilityScanResults.violations.map(violation => ({
    rule: violation.id,
    // These are CSS selectors which uniquely identify each element with
    // a violation of the rule in question.
    targets: violation.nodes.map(node => node.target),
  }));

  return JSON.stringify(violationFingerprints, null, 2);
}
```

## Exporting scan results as a test attachment

Most accessibility tests are primarily concerned with the `violations` property of the axe scan results. However, the scan results contain more than just `violations`. For example, the results also contain information about rules which passed and about elements which axe found to have inconclusive results for some rules. This information can be useful for debugging tests that aren't detecting all the violations you expect them to.

To include *all* of the scan results as part of your test results for debugging purposes, you can add the scan results as a test attachment with [`testInfo.attach()`](./api/class-testinfo#test-info-attach). [Reporters](./test-reporters) can then embed or link the full results as part of your test output.

The following example demonstrates attaching scan results to a test:

```js
test('example with attachment', async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
  await page.goto('https://your-site.com/');

  const accessibilityScanResults = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze();

  await testInfo.attach('accessibility-scan-results', {
    body: JSON.stringify(accessibilityScanResults, null, 2),
    contentType: 'application/json'
  });

  expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);
});
```

## Using a test fixture for common axe configuration

[Test fixtures](./test-fixtures) are a good way to share common `AxeBuilder` configuration across many tests. Some scenarios where this might be useful include:
* Using a common set of rules among all of your tests
* Suppressing a known violation in a common element which appears in many different pages
* Attaching standalone accessibility reports consistently for many scans

The following example demonstrates creating and using a test fixture that covers each of those scenarios.
