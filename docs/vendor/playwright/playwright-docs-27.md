## Managing browser binaries

Playwright downloads Chromium, WebKit and Firefox browsers into the OS-specific cache folders:

- `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\ms-playwright` on Windows
- `~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright` on macOS
- `~/.cache/ms-playwright` on Linux

These browsers will take a few hundred megabytes of disk space when installed:

```bash
du -hs ~/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/*
281M  chromium-XXXXXX
187M  firefox-XXXX
180M  webkit-XXXX
```

You can override default behavior using environment variables. When installing Playwright, ask it to download browsers into a specific location:

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=js
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers npx playwright install
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=js
set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\pw-browsers
npx playwright install
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=js
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$Env:USERPROFILE\pw-browsers"
npx playwright install
```

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=python
pip install playwright
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers python -m playwright install
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=python
set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\pw-browsers
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=python
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$Env:USERPROFILE\pw-browsers"
pip install playwright
playwright install
```

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=java
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install"
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=java
set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\pw-browsers
mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install"
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=java
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$Env:USERPROFILE\pw-browsers"
mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install"
```

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=csharp
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 install
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=csharp
set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\pw-browsers
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 install
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=csharp
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$Env:USERPROFILE\pw-browsers"
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 install
```

When running Playwright scripts, ask Playwright to search for browsers in a shared location.

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=js
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers npx playwright test
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=js
set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\pw-browsers
npx playwright test
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=js
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$Env:USERPROFILE\pw-browsers"
npx playwright test
```

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=python
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers python playwright_script.py
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=python
set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\pw-browsers
python playwright_script.py
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=python

$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$Env:USERPROFILE\pw-browsers"
python playwright_script.py
```

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=java
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers mvn test
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=java
set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\pw-browsers
mvn test
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=java
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$Env:USERPROFILE\pw-browsers"
mvn test
```

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=csharp
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers dotnet test
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=csharp
set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=%USERPROFILE%\pw-browsers
dotnet test
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=csharp
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$Env:USERPROFILE\pw-browsers"
dotnet test
```

Playwright keeps track of packages that need those browsers and will garbage collect them as you update Playwright to the newer versions.

:::note
Developers can opt into this mode by exporting `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=$HOME/pw-browsers` in their `.bashrc`.
:::

### Hermetic install
* langs: js

You can opt into the hermetic install and place binaries in the local folder:


```bash tab=bash-bash
# Places binaries to node_modules/playwright-core/.local-browsers
PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0 npx playwright install
```

```batch tab=bash-batch
# Places binaries to node_modules\playwright-core\.local-browsers
set PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0
npx playwright install
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell
# Places binaries to node_modules\playwright-core\.local-browsers
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0
npx playwright install
```

:::note
`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` does not change installation path for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
:::

### Skip browser downloads
* langs: java

In certain cases, it is desired to avoid browser downloads altogether because
browser binaries are managed separately.

This can be done by setting `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD` variable before installation.

```bash tab=bash-bash lang=java
PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 mvn test
```

```batch tab=bash-batch lang=java
set PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1
mvn test
```

```powershell tab=bash-powershell lang=java
$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1
mvn test
```

### Stale browser removal

Playwright keeps track of the clients that use its browsers. When there are no more clients that require a particular version of the browser, that version is deleted from the system. That way you can safely use Playwright instances of different versions and at the same time, you don't waste disk space for the browsers that are no longer in use.

To opt-out from the unused browser removal, you can set the `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_GC=1` environment variable.

### List all installed browsers:

Prints list of browsers from all playwright installations on the machine.

```bash js
npx playwright install --list
```

```bash java
mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="install --list"
```

```bash python
playwright install --list
```

```bash csharp
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 install --list
```

### Uninstall browsers

This will remove the browsers (chromium, firefox, webkit) of the current Playwright installation:

```bash js
npx playwright uninstall
```

```bash java
mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="uninstall"
```

```bash python
playwright uninstall
```

```bash csharp
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 uninstall
```

To remove browsers of other Playwright installations as well, pass `--all` flag:

```bash js
npx playwright uninstall --all
```

```bash java
mvn exec:java -e -D exec.mainClass=com.microsoft.playwright.CLI -D exec.args="uninstall --all"
```

```bash python
playwright uninstall --all
```

```bash csharp
pwsh bin/Debug/netX/playwright.ps1 uninstall --all
```
