### Creating a fixture

This example fixture creates an `AxeBuilder` object which is pre-configured with shared `withTags()` and `exclude()` configuration.

```js tab=js-ts title="axe-test.ts"
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
import AxeBuilder from '@axe-core/playwright';

type AxeFixture = {
  makeAxeBuilder: () => AxeBuilder;
};

// Extend base test by providing "makeAxeBuilder"
//
// This new "test" can be used in multiple test files, and each of them will get
// a consistently configured AxeBuilder instance.
export const test = base.extend<AxeFixture>({
  makeAxeBuilder: async ({ page }, use) => {
    const makeAxeBuilder = () => new AxeBuilder({ page })
        .withTags(['wcag2a', 'wcag2aa', 'wcag21a', 'wcag21aa'])
        .exclude('#commonly-reused-element-with-known-issue');

    await use(makeAxeBuilder);
  }
});
export { expect } from '@playwright/test';
```

```js tab=js-js title="axe-test.js"
const base = require('@playwright/test');
const AxeBuilder = require('@axe-core/playwright').default;

// Extend base test by providing "makeAxeBuilder"
//
// This new "test" can be used in multiple test files, and each of them will get
// a consistently configured AxeBuilder instance.
exports.test = base.test.extend({
  makeAxeBuilder: async ({ page }, use) => {
    const makeAxeBuilder = () => new AxeBuilder({ page })
        .withTags(['wcag2a', 'wcag2aa', 'wcag21a', 'wcag21aa'])
        .exclude('#commonly-reused-element-with-known-issue');

    await use(makeAxeBuilder);
  }
});
exports.expect = base.expect;
```

### Using a fixture

To use the fixture, replace the earlier examples' `new AxeBuilder({ page })` with the newly defined `makeAxeBuilder` fixture:

```js
const { test, expect } = require('./axe-test');

test('example using custom fixture', async ({ page, makeAxeBuilder }) => {
  await page.goto('https://your-site.com/');

  const accessibilityScanResults = await makeAxeBuilder()
      // Automatically uses the shared AxeBuilder configuration,
      // but supports additional test-specific configuration too
      .include('#specific-element-under-test')
      .analyze();

  expect(accessibilityScanResults.violations).toEqual([]);
});
```

## Introduction

Playwright performs a range of actionability checks on the elements before making actions to ensure these actions
behave as expected. It auto-waits for all the relevant checks to pass and only then performs the requested action. If the required checks do not pass within the given `timeout`, action fails with the `TimeoutError`.

For example, for [`method: Locator.click`], Playwright will ensure that:
- locator resolves to exactly one element
- element is [Visible]
- element is [Stable], as in not animating or completed animation
- element [Receives Events], as in not obscured by other elements
- element is [Enabled]

Here is the complete list of actionability checks performed for each action:

| Action | [Visible] | [Stable] | [Receives Events] | [Enabled] | [Editable] |
| :- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| [`method: Locator.check`] | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | - |
| [`method: Locator.click`] | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | - |
| [`method: Locator.dblclick`] | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | - |
| [`method: Locator.setChecked`] | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | - |
| [`method: Locator.tap`] | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | - |
| [`method: Locator.uncheck`] | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | - |
| [`method: Locator.hover`] | Yes | Yes | Yes | - | - |
| [`method: Locator.dragTo`] | Yes | Yes | Yes | - | - |
| [`method: Locator.screenshot`] | Yes | Yes | - | - | - |
| [`method: Locator.fill`] | Yes | - | - | Yes | Yes |
| [`method: Locator.clear`] | Yes | - | - | Yes | Yes |
| [`method: Locator.selectOption`] | Yes | - | - | Yes | - |
| [`method: Locator.selectText`] | Yes | - | - | - | - |
| [`method: Locator.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded`] | - | Yes | - | - | - |
| [`method: Locator.blur`] | - | - | - | - | - |
| [`method: Locator.dispatchEvent`] | - | - | - | - | - |
| [`method: Locator.focus`] | - | - | - | - | - |
| [`method: Locator.press`] | - | - | - | - | - |
| [`method: Locator.pressSequentially`] | - | - | - | - | - |
| [`method: Locator.setInputFiles`] | - | - | - | - | - |

## Forcing actions

Some actions like [`method: Locator.click`] support `force` option that disables non-essential actionability checks,
for example passing truthy `force` to [`method: Locator.click`] method will not check that the target element actually
receives click events.

## Assertions

Playwright includes auto-retrying assertions that remove flakiness by waiting until the condition is met, similarly to auto-waiting before actions.

| Assertion | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeAttached`] | Element is attached |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeChecked`] | Checkbox is checked |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeDisabled`] | Element is disabled |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeEditable`] | Element is editable |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeEmpty`] | Container is empty |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeEnabled`] | Element is enabled |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeFocused`] | Element is focused |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeHidden`] | Element is not visible |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeInViewport`] | Element intersects viewport |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toBeVisible`] | Element is visible |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toContainText`] | Element contains text |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveAttribute`] | Element has a DOM attribute |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveClass`] | Element has a class property |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveCount`] | List has exact number of children |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveCSS`] | Element has CSS property |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveId`] | Element has an ID |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveJSProperty`] | Element has a JavaScript property |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveText`] | Element matches text |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveValue`] | Input has a value |
| [`method: LocatorAssertions.toHaveValues`] | Select has options selected |
| [`method: PageAssertions.toHaveTitle`] | Page has a title |
| [`method: PageAssertions.toHaveURL`] | Page has a URL |
| [`method: APIResponseAssertions.toBeOK`] | Response has an OK status |

## Visible

Element is considered visible when it has non-empty bounding box and does not have `visibility:hidden` computed style.

Note that according to this definition:
* Elements of zero size **are not** considered visible.
* Elements with `display:none` **are not** considered visible.
* Elements with `opacity:0` **are** considered visible.

## Stable

Element is considered stable when it has maintained the same bounding box for at least two consecutive animation frames.

## Enabled

Element is considered enabled when it is **not disabled**.

Element is **disabled** when:
- it is a `<button>`, `<select>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<option>` or `<optgroup>` with a `[disabled]` attribute;
- it is a `<button>`, `<select>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<option>` or `<optgroup>` that is a part of a `<fieldset>` with a `[disabled]` attribute;
- it is a descendant of an element with `[aria-disabled=true]` attribute.
