## Headless

Headless mode is another option available in the browser mode. In headless mode, the browser runs in the background without a user interface, which makes it useful for running automated tests. The headless option in Vitest can be set to a boolean value to enable or disable headless mode.

When using headless mode, Vitest won't open the UI automatically. If you want to continue using the UI but have tests run headlessly, you can install the [`@vitest/ui`](/guide/ui) package and pass the `--ui` flag when running Vitest.

Here's an example configuration enabling headless mode:

```ts [vitest.config.ts]
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'
import { playwright } from '@vitest/browser-playwright'

export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    browser: {
      provider: playwright(),
      enabled: true,
      headless: true,
    },
  }
})
```

You can also set headless mode using the `--browser.headless` flag in the CLI, like this:

```sh
npx vitest --browser.headless
```

In this case, Vitest will run in headless mode using the Chrome browser.

::: warning
Headless mode is not available by default. You need to use either [`playwright`](https://npmx.dev/package/playwright) or [`webdriverio`](https://npmx.dev/package/webdriverio) providers to enable this feature.
